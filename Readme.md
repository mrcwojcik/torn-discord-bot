# Discord Bot for Torn Faction server

I prepare a discord bot for Torn Faction server. His tasks include: informing about what managers want, generating funny texts, reminding about events.

First version of bot was written in JavaScript: [My Discord Bot in JS](https://github.com/mrcwojcik/discordBot).

This time it's prepared in Java with usage of Discord4J library. I'm using here Reactor (to learn).
